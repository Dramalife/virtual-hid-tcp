# Virtual HID over TCP

A HID device emulation which can be controlled remotely over tcp socket connection.You can create joystick, keyboard or mouse device and send events like **joystick axis and buttons, keyboard key presses, mouse pointer movements** over network.

Server side is written in C and currently works only in Linux.But client side is platform independent so can be written in any platform&language with using tcp socket connection.
